## Overview

The Browserbase MCP server is an implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that allows AI agents to interact with web browsers in the cloud. Leveraging Browserbase, Puppeteer, and Stagehand, it provides functionalities such as web page manipulation, data extraction, screenshot capture, and JavaScript execution, all through a standardized MCP interface. This setup enables seamless integration of web context into AI workflows.

## Use Cases

The Browserbase MCP server offers several key use cases for AI agents:

- **Web Automation:** Enables AI agents to control cloud-based browsers for tasks like website navigation, form filling, and interaction with web elements.
- **Data Extraction:** Facilitates the extraction of structured data from web pages, allowing AI agents to gather information from the web.
- **Visual Capture:** Allows AI agents to capture full-page or element-specific screenshots, useful for visual analysis or documentation.
- **Dynamic Web Interaction:** Enables the execution of custom JavaScript within the browser context, providing advanced control and interaction with web applications.
